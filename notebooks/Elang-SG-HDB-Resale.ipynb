    "\n",
    "Public housing in Singapore is subsidised housing built and managed by the government under the Housing and Development Board (HDB). Most public housing in Singapore is owner-occupied. Under Singapore’s housing ownership programme, housing units are sold to applicants who meet certain income, citizenship and property ownership requirements, on a 99-year leasehold. The estate’s land and common areas continue to be owned by the government. Owner-occupied public housing can be sold to others in a resale market, subject to certain restrictions. Prices within the resale market are not regulated by the government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demand for resale flats since the end of the Circuit Breaker has pushed prices and sales to new highs. According to the HDB Price Index in Q2 2021, resale flat prices climbed 3% from Q1 2021, growing for the fifth consecutive quarter since Q2 2020. Prices were also 11% higher compared to a year ago. As data scientists, we want to understand the factors driving the price of resale flats as and provide predicted sale price for property portals.\n",
